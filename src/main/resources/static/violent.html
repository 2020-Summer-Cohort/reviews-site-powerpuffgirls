            Afro Samurai focuses on a samurai named Afro whose mission is to get
            the number 1 headband and avenge his father. The setting is somewhat
            feudal however some characters have androids and other futuristic
            technology. The show focuses on battles between the eponymous
            character and others who are seeking the headband.
