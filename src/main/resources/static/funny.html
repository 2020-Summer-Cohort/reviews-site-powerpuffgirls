            This was my favorite show growing up! I always wanted to be a power
            puff girl. I loved their tenacity and the show has great villains.

            Takes place in another dimension, in an eponymous jail inside of a
            volcano. Superjail is a psychedelic very violent show that focuses
            on different aspects of this fictional jail, it mostly operates as a
            comedy for adults. Themes are often about conflicts between
            prisoners.

            Is honestly a great animated series for all ages. It tackles
            everyday issues with such depth and complexity that children can
            digest and adults can fully grasp. In terms of characters is one the
            most diverse shows on television in racial and LGBT representation.
            Perfectly blending themes of love,trauma and growth realistically.
            My personal favorite part of the series is the allusion to 90's
            Japanese RPG's and Shojo series.
