        <h3>Power Puff Girls</h3>
        <p>
          This was my favorite show growing up! I always wanted to be a power
          puff girl. I loved their tenacity and the show has great villains.

        <h3>SuperJail</h3>
        <p>
          Takes place in another dimension, in an eponymous jail inside of a
          volcano. Superjail is a psychedelic very violent show that focuses on
          different aspects of this fictional jail, it mostly operates as a
          comedy for adults. Themes are often about conflicts between prisoners.

        <h3>Steven Universe</h3>
        <p>
          Is honestly a great animated series for all ages. It tackles everyday
          issues with such depth and complexity that children can digest and
          adults can fully grasp. In terms of characters is one the most diverse
          shows on television in racial and LGBT representation. Perfectly
          blending themes of love,trauma and growth realistically. My personal
          favorite part of the series is the allusion to 90's Japanese RPG's and
          Shojo series.
