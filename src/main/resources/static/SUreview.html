            Is honestly a great animated series for all ages. It tackles everyday
            issues with such depth and complexity that children can digest and
            adults can fully grasp. In terms of characters is one the most diverse
            shows on television in racial and LGBT representation. Perfectly
            blending themes of love,trauma and growth realistically. My personal
            favorite part of the series is the allusion to 90's Japanese RPG's and
            Shojo series.
