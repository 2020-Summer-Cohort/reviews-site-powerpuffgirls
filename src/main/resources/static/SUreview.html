      Is honestly a great animated series for all ages. It tackles everyday
      issues with such depth and complexity that children can digest and adults
      can fully grasp. In terms of characters is one the most diverse shows on
      television in racial and LGBT representation. Perfectly blending themes of
      love,trauma and growth realistically. My personal favorite part of the
      series is the allusion to 90's Japanese RPG's and Shojo series.
